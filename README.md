## 🧠 Game Logic Overview

1. A 2D grid of cells is created dynamically.
2. A recursive backtracking algorithm generates the maze paths.
3. The player (a movable ball) is placed at the top-left cell.
4. The goal (a box) is placed at the bottom-right cell.
5. Use arrow keys to move through the maze.
6. Upon reaching the goal, walls collapse using gravity to create a win animation.
